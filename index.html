        <p>Jacksonville Florida for several decades has served as a crossroads for aspiring 
            and accomplished Rock Artists.  Several established world famous bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd 
            and Molly Hatchet started in Jacksonville and others like the Allman Brothers and Dr. John 
            made Jacksonville their home for several years on the road to the top of the charts. </p>
